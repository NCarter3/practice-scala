### Write About Scala

  - What's easy to do in Scala? What's not?

  It is really easy to do list style comprehesion a la racket with the concepts of `first :: second :: rest` that allows matching of the form of lists. Pattern matching in general is really easy. The ability to do very complicated case statements with variable assignments allows for interesting and novel matching characterizations.

  - What is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of Scala 
  made? Why?

  We like that the language is designed as a functional language, and that there is the ability to treat functions as variables and vice versa. This feature allows for very powerful composition of ideas. The design choice to have semi-colon inference is also very nice.

  - What is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do
  you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?

  The getters and setters are complicated to understand syntactically, especially when you want to override them. The designers of Scala may have done this so that you can name your functions whatever you want to.

  - What Scala features would you like to learn more about?

  We want to learn more about apply and currying as well as traits, ojects, classes, methods, functions, and their differences. Also, we find the type system very confusing and we aren't quite sure what to do with Nil and None values.
